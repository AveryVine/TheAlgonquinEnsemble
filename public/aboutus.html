                        <p>Born and raised in Canada's capital city, Kathryn Briggs has committed her life to creating and sharing
                            music. She is a well-respected pianist, teacher, composer and performer. Beginning at the age
                            of 7, Ms. Briggs excelled in her conservatory studies and completed her pedagogical training
                            at the age of 18 with concert pianist and music educator Irene Woodburn-Wright. In her late teens,
                            she conducted and accompanied children’s and youth choirs, mentoring with Ottawa’s award-winning
                            choir master and Order of Canada recipient Barbara Clark.
                        </p>
                        <p>Ms. Briggs has managed her own private teaching studio for over 30 years, teaching a diverse range
                            of Western music, including classical, popular and jazz repertoire, as well as improvisation
                            and theory. Throughout her teaching career, Ms. Briggs has mentored many student-teachers, both
                            in her private studio and at private music schools in the Ottawa area. One of her greatest gifts
                            as a music teacher is creating musicians for life.
                        </p>
                        <p>As a recording artist, Ms. Briggs has a solo album of original compositions for piano entitled “Small
                            Awakenings” to her credit. In addition to her solo project, she has released 2 CDs with the configuration
                            KEWT; a trio comprised of her life- partner guitarist Terry Tufts and acclaimed Canadian bassist
                            John Geggie. Ms. Briggs also arranged and recorded “Carols For A Christmas Eve” with JUNO award-winning
                            artist David Francey.
                        </p>
                        <p>As a founding member of The Algonquin Ensemble, Ms. Briggs was integral in the vision and manifestation
                            of the acclaimed production “Sonic Palette: Tom Thomson’s Voice Through Music”. This premiered
                            at The McMichael Canadian Art Collection in July 2017 to mark the 100th anniversary of the artist’s
                            untimely death. The Algonquin Ensemble has since released a CD entitled “Sonic Palette” in which
                            she is credited with co-production, composition and string arrangements. The project continues
                            to grow and has garnered standing ovations at each performance thus far.</p>
                        <p>Ms. Briggs has toured Canada from coast to coast to coast both on her own behalf and as an accompanist
                            for artists including David Francey, Laura Smith, Kelly Trottier and the Inuit duo Tudjaat. </p>
